```
Fud AI makes calorie tracking effortless with AI-powered food recognition. Snap a photo, speak it, or type it — and get instant nutrition data: calories, protein, carbs, fats, and 9 micronutrients.

Coach: a multi-turn AI chat that sees your profile, weight history, and food log. Ask anything in plain English — "expected weight in 30 days?", "how's my protein this week?", "what should I eat tonight?".

Fud AI is free, open source, and privacy-first. Bring your own API key. All data stays on your device.

HOW TO USE
1) Set up your profile with goals + body stats

## Data Safety Form

Walk through the Play Console wizard with these answers:

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Does your app collect or share any of the required user data types? | **No** |
| Is all of the user data collected by your app encrypted in transit? | **Yes** (HTTPS to all AI/STT providers) |
| Do you provide a way for users to request that their data be deleted? | **Yes** — Settings → Delete All Data wipes profile, food log, weight history, chat, and API keys |

**Why "No" on collection:** Google's policy excludes "data sent to a server based on a user's explicit action and where the user is informed about the destination." Users explicitly pick an AI provider, paste their own API key, and the destination is named on-screen — that's user-initiated transfer to a user-chosen third party, not collection by Fud AI. The app has no servers, no analytics, and never sees the food data.

If a reviewer questions this, point them at the privacy policy at https://fud-ai.app/privacy.html which already discloses the third-party AI provider model.

## App Content Declarations

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Target audience age | 13+ (general — no age-restricted content) |
| Ads | No |
| In-app purchases | No |
| Government app | No |
| News app | No |
| COVID-19 contact tracing | No |
| Content rating questionnaire | Complete in console — answer "No" to all violence/gambling/sexual content questions; expect Everyone / PEGI 3 rating |

## Visual Assets

Prepared and uploaded manually outside this file:
- Screenshots (Play Console requires at least 2, allows up to 8) — phone screenshots at 1080×2400 or similar portrait aspect
- Feature graphic — 1024×500
- App icon — Play Console pulls automatically from the AAB (`app/src/main/res/mipmap-*`)

## Reviewer Notes (Internal Testing → Production review)
```
1) Free and open source — no sign-in, no subscriptions, no ads.
2) Bring-your-own-API-key model. To test: Settings → AI Provider → enter any valid Google Gemini key. Free key at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
3) API keys stored locally in EncryptedSharedPreferences (AES-256). Fud AI has no servers and collects no data.
4) Health Connect integration is opt-in (Settings → Health Connect). Without granting, the app works fully offline (just no Samsung Health / Fitbit import).
5) Voice input requires microphone permission, snap-a-meal requires camera permission, both prompted on first use.
6) Test device used in development: iQOO Z9 5G (OriginOS 6, Android 15).
```
